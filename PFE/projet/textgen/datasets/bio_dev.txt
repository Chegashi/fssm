JavaScript / Node js /  React js / Redux / MongoDB / Git ,Learning to write programs stretches your mind, and helps you think better, creates a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains.” —Bill Gates, Co-Chairman, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Co-Founder, Microsoft  I couldn't agree more. Learning to write programs is the equivalent of giving the mind a paintbrush that creates in infinite dimensions. At the end of the day, what we're doing in programming is solving problems.   That's why I do it. That's why I have been drawn to programming - I want to have the tools (mental and technical) available to solve problems in an effective, and efficient way that also engages my senses. I want to problem-solve with creativity and logic. I want to create with 1's and 0's.  I see development as a human-centered endeavor via the use of human-created machines.   Or, to quote the great Michael Scott,   “People will never be replaced by machines. In the end, life and business are about human connections. And computers are about trying to murder you in a lake. And to me the choice is easy.   - Michael Scott, The Office   (Season 4, Episode 3)  I have a board of directors in the form of digital and live mentors. I access them through podcasts, books, YouTube, and in person. Here are a few of the principles I glean from my mentors and things I do my best to emulate every day.   - Stand up straight and put your chaos into order.  - Do hard things. You'll be grateful for the struggle.  - Be kind to everyone. Life is too short to be otherwise.   - Maintain a growth mindset and stay curious. ( a la Richard Feynman)  - Be engaged in a career field where helping others and providing value is paramount.   - Most fear is in our heads. Real-life is never as scary as what goes on in our minds.   - Everything is data. Do not get emotionally attached to data or allow emotion and bias to override data-driven decisions.  - Fail fast, fail often

At 25 years old I am a serial entrepreneur and co-founder of Goat 🐐specialising in social media and influencer campaigns globally with over 120 staff in 4 international offices.  At 16 I realised the academic path was not for me 🚫I needed a more direct and creative path to success, although the media industry had another idea and rejected me for being too young. So I went away and set up Fresh Press, a football publishing house which grew, by the time I was 18, to over 60 websites and a bigger digital writing team than the Daily Mail. 👶🏼  It’s safe to say I wanted a challenge and so I took on my next role as the fifth employee at Sportlobster, putting my faith in the sports app startup as their Social Media Manager leading a team of three. 🏃🏼‍♂️Quickly advancing to Head of Social; it’s here that I met my Goat co-founders Arron Shepherd and Nick Cooke. 🙋🏻‍♂️  We left Sportlobster after three years and established Goat in August 2015.

Biography:  Growing up in Manchester, Oliver left school aged 16 with one GCSE. Completing a modern apprenticeship in IT, he became a self-taught contract website developer for major global organisations, before combining his technical abilities with his love of fitness and nutrition to launch Myprotein in 2004 with just a £500 overdraft.  As the driving force behind its inspirational and well documented growth, the bootstrapped Myprotein went on to become the number one sports nutrition brand globally.  Oliver's entrepreneurship skills have seen accolades come in thick and fast, including EY Young Entrepreneur of the Year, 'Rising Star' (IoD Awards), Young Company of the Year (Great British Entrepreneur Awards) and SME of the Year (National Business Awards). Myprotein placed 21st in the Sunday Times Fast Track rankings in 2009.  After a heavily contested sales process, including offers from some of the largest blue chip FMCG brands, institutional investors and private equity, Oliver went onto complete a high-profile sale of Myprotein to The Hut Group for a reported £58m, which resulted in a combined shares and cash consideration.  He is currently Non Executive Director at The Hut Group, and CEO of investment vehicle OSC Group.

Backend Developer, I’m inspired by building software stack and have been influenced by algorithms in a big way, especially their applications in solving real-world problems.  I started out with competitive programming and participated in ICPC regionals. After that, I decided to test my abilities in software engineering, because I believed it would challenge me to learn quickly, and creatively apply my knowledge to help improve our world, in small amounts. I got obsessed with building technologies to help people around the globe using my skills in system design and algorithms. When I work with software development teams, they tell me I made an impact on the company (sometimes even the users), and that’s my favourite part of it.  I welcome the chance to connect with you and talk more about complex problems and their solutions. 
Innovating in the new to me means being ever-curious to learn and finding better ways of unlocking value for companies with new technologies and business models.”  Growth Strategy | M&A | Innovation | Organization Design | Operating Model Transformation | Global Leadership at Scale | Digital Transformation    My expertise lies in taking complex subjects and making them simple. I strive to understand the people who are at the heart of every initiative and bring them together. Performing well for clients is a must for me. I spend a great deal of time reflecting on what worked in the past and what failed. History matters. Often I am found working on a select number of secret projects that challenge the status quo, and inspire people to think and create new business models.   In addition to helping Accenture “lead in the NEW,” I enjoy serving as an executive coach, advising leaders on strategy, organization design, leadership development, mergers and acquisitions and ultimately, how to be the disruptors, not the disrupted.  Drop me an InMail. It would be my pleasure to hear from you.

I have been in the IT Services Industry since 1985. I have played various roles starting from being Software Developer to leading Engineering Teams to develop products and provides services to customers.   In 1999, the entreprenurial bug bit me as well. Along with a set of like minded professionals, we started Mindtree. And seven years of hard work and good, clean fun, we were listed in the Indian Stock Exchange in March 2007. We became, I think, the first VC funded IT services company to be listed. Have played various roles in Mindtree - as we evolved from a startup to a young adult ! The roles were quite varied from Heading Global Delivery & Operations, to Service Line Head. I became the COO in 2013, a position I held till July 2019. During these years, we built on our strengths and increased our capabilities and our our capacities. We became a USD $1 Billion revenue company on FY19 - a great achievement from a VC funded startup to a billion dollar enterprise.

Hey, I'm Tom... I  build and grow software businesses.  Before that I studied Chemistry @ Imperial College London and followed the herd to a management consulting job in the City Of London.

I have never found myself being a fan of mediocrity and I tried to develop the habit of facing and overcoming challenges to learn more and to achieve more!  I love Computer Science and Engineering. That is why I studied Software Engineering as an undergraduate student.  Later, I found myself gravitated toward the world of Data Mining. This quotation stuck with me:  We're drowning in data, but starving for knowledge!  I applied and got admitted to the best university of my home country to study Data Mining, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, etc. I broke out of my comfort zone and lots of great things have happened since then. I earned my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and I ranked 1st among all Computer Engineering graduates.  As one of the novel and challenging applications of machine learning, I chose to study DNA microarrays of cancer tumors in my MS thesis. This opened the door for me to the interdisciplinary world of Bioinformatics. I applied to USC which has the oldest and one of the most reputable Computational Biology and Bioinformatics programs in the United States. I was honored to win the USC Provost's PhD Fellowship which is the most prestigious university-wide fellowship.  Shortly, I found that statistics plays a very important role in this field and to better understand and apply data analysis and machine learning algorithms, I need to better know the underlying statistical concepts. I embraced this challenge and I earned a Master’s degree in Statistics in parallel with my PhD studies on computational problems in metagenomics.  I believe I am a good team player and a quick learner. I have always developed myself to be hard-working, goal-oriented, self-motivated, and good at creative and critical thinking. Now, I am so excited and passionate to use my extensive academic training to solve real-world problems in the industry and I enthusiastically believe the upcoming challenges help me grow further and bring more value to my career. , SAP , President

I'm the Cold Call King. Scratch that, I'm just an ordinary guy who cold calls as part of my living. The only time I feel like an actual King is when I make a human to human connection with a complete stranger, which isn't often enough, but when it happens, it's one of the best feelings in the World. It's not like holding my kids tight, or kissing my Wife or running buck naked in a dew-covered meadow of marigolds...but connecting on a call in a very real, human to human way with potential new customers, is right up there.  A year ago, I started recording real life (just me) videos of my cold calling escapades and posting them here. I see it as a warts-and-all exhibition-of-a-thing I've come to understand, respect, and constantly want to improve. See my Activity section for the latest hits and misses.

I love applying 3D simulation to business problems which are impractical to solve by other means. We founded Buzz 3D to do precisely this, from Ad Billboard pre-testing, to Planogram Market Research & our latest 3DCX technology for full-scale interactive retail store simulations online.  3DCX is designed for retailers who’ve long suspected today’s online “shopping” is really just online buying – no consumer-experience; just a race to the lowest price, and that’s why audiences are flocking to the big online disruptors.  No more.  3DCX blows open the traditional constraints of 2D web shopping to create a unique, custom-built, plug-in eCommerce solution delivered straight to the browser, no apps.  Buzz 3DCX changes the game. With a Brand-Personalised 3D online sales platform, you can apply your Visual Merchandising knowledge, place Points of Sale, Commercial Messaging, take Shopper-Flow and Adjacencies into account; all things you have vast experience in.  The best part is that shopper behaviour online in a simulated store environment matches real-world behaviour to the tune of 92%. Anything that works as a sales driver in the physical world will work in 3DCX, and vice versa!  Analytics of all shopper behaviour, machine-learning algorithms to train A.I. for insight-predictions, “getting behind the eyes of the shopper” to explore best practice AND translate this to your physical stores ... all of this is not only possible, it’s part of our roadmap. (We’re even including in-line advertising using 3D Out Of Home Ad Billboards; place as many as you like and cycle the content, showing 100's of ads without ever disturbing the shopper).  We’re currently in Phase 1

So passionate about training, developing and coaching salespeople that I created a platform to enable organisations to define, develop and measure 'what good looks like' across their whole sales team.   If you want to drive improvement and transformation in your sales teams then you need to start by (1) defining 'what good looks like' then (2) developing to that standard and (3) constantly measure the outcomes.  So many organisations miss step (1) and (3) and so many still use an informal coaching process or leave it up to managers for (2).   @e4enable solves that problem...  I've over 20 years experience in Sales Leadership & Transformation within cyber security, technology and data companies, building, developing and managing high performing sales teams.

I’ve spent most of my career in sales, I love it.  I love the visibility of sales, the constant need to evolve how you win, the days you can celebrate with your team and the ones where you need to put your arm round them and show its going to be OK.  It’s a tough environment to be in but its always made me feel so alive.   There's been a collision of things that demand us to reimagine the old sales machine and start building teams that are 'in it together'. Our buyer is smarter, our employees needs have changed and there are layers to our sales team structures that require our people to rely on each other if we're going to suceed.    Building the team that wins together is where i'm happiest and feel incredibly lucky to have the opportunity to be part of the Jiminny team and help other leaders do just that. ,

What sets me apart from other European marketing leaders is that I come with a global following of sales and marketing decision-makers built-in. I have deep expertise across digital/content/social media/ demand gen (I literally teach a course at UC Berkeley on the topic), and that I understand first-hand the expectations of a US-based tech company operating in Europe. I specialize in demand generation and pipeline marketing, and I learned from the best in the business during my time at Marketo when I reported directly to co-founder Jon Miller.  I wrote the best selling marketing book Welcome to the Funnel: How to turn Your Content and Social Media Marketing up to Eleven and self-published it selling 22,000 copies worldwide. A revised edition is in the works and currently slated for a Summer 2020 release, along with two additional books I've been working on for the past three years.   In addition to my marketing duties and team building, I deliver 50 plus keynotes, sessions, and workshops around the globe each year having graced the stages at the most prominent digital conferences in the world including Dreamforce, Content Marketing World, SMX, Business Insider Trends Festival, Marketing Profs B2B Forum, Marketo Marketing Nation, and many more.   Most recently I was the Head of Brand Marketing at Microsoft in a hybrid role focusing on the 5th largest business in Microsoft and bringing next-generation demand generation & digital capabilities to a mature giant, with the goal of turning disruption into an ally. A major focus of this role is teaching marketers and partnering with agencies on how to leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning to better understand the customer decision journey, make better use of their data

CIO or head of technology in your organization, how are you coping with the data deluge to determine which datasets enable you to gain insights and create value, and which are just noise?  Organizations know they need to be more data-driven, but they are also struggling to identify their most valuable categories of data. To glean real insights from data, we need to put these capabilities in the hands of decision-makers at critical junctures. This will likely entail a transition of data from existing silos, and making data analytics tools more human-centric and embedded.  As the Executive Vice President of Strategic Clients at Qlik, I lead a multi-disciplinary team that blends sales, value engineering and consulting services. My teams advise strategic clients on their digital and data transformational strategies for large enterprise customers to maximize the value of their overall investments in data and in Qlik’s data integration and analytics platforms.  With more than 22 years’ experience as a senior executive across the AI and data analytics space, I consult with clients in every industry to help them define their data strategies for improving revenue goals and driving business process efficiencies. I am part of Qlik's Harvard Customer Advisory group, which is a community of data and AI executives who focus on AI and analytics as a strategic imperative in their organization. I was also recently included among the “top 50 most powerful women in tech” by the National Diversity Council.  I believe in taking a human-centric approach to conversations around AI and analytics; technology must be applied to a human context in both business and consumer scenarios. Much my focus is around these final aspects of delivery, because success in data is about being able to fundamentally change the culture and mindset within the organization.  If you would like to discuss how your organization can start leveraging the full value of your data, please feel free to get in touch with me

As requested I learned Parallax and javascript animation, I made a lot of websites using these javascript skills.  At Professional Insurance Agents, there was a job I took over in mobile phone application development. I learned JAVA and Objective-C and completed the task.   I am good at seeing customers' styles and what the customer really wants in design.

Freelance Web Developer based in Blackpool, UK. I bring your awesome ideas to life. Got an awesome idea? Lets connect, I'd love to hear how I could help.
Full-stack software developer, writer, and communications specialist based in Chicago.  I'm a software developer with a diverse background in languages, research and teaching. Throughout my career, I have synthesized information in clear, intuitive, and accessible formats. Only now, I do it in Ruby, Rails and JavaScript.  I obtained my B.A. in English Literature from the University of Michigan, and then went abroad to teach English as a second language - first at an NGO in Cambodia, then with business clients at major international firms in Argentina and South Korea. Next, I obtained an MFA, conducting intensive study and research as part of my multidisciplinary degree program. After graduation,  I worked as a communications specialist before bringing my research and writing skills into the legal field.  My most recent job at an immigration law firm included highly complex work in research, legal writing, and in-depth client case reports on an intensive production schedule. Inspired by the case management systems I had seen at my previous law firm, I started looking for ways to build efficiency into our process. I developed a set of templates for petitions and supporting materials as well as a detailed set of informational materials for clients to assist in the petition-building process. Moving from these templating and process-management projects to coding was a natural transition - I wanted to work on these same concerns at a higher level.  So now I'm a coder. I'm fascinated by the ways that programming can be used to create intuitive interfaces, and I'm excited to use my communications expertise as a developer.

A lot of new businesses do not have all the required aspects of a business. We are able to offer packages to ensure you leave with everything you need to have a fully functioning business.

We can discuss the design and content of it before it is created so we do not need to recreate it multiple times, hopefully we can get it correct on the first go. ,

I grew up on a ranch in Paradise Valley, Montana near Chico Hot Springs. Working on the ranch instilled work ethic and self motivation in me. Filled with this drive, I started mowing the local school's yards twice a month throughout the summers, at the age of 12.   In 2004 I moved to Billings, Montana, where I have been deeply involved in the local business community ever since. A serial entrepreneur, I've run multiple businesses in our local community. The first business, a janitorial and carpet cleaning company, founded in 2005, has employed over 50 locals.   Moving on to the media industry, several partners and I founded Green Directory Montana in the spring of 2007. Green Directory's sustainability ranking software awarded points based on sustainable or  green  actions. These points counted towards a business's total  Green Score,  which in turn ranked them against other businesses in their category and throughout the entire site. It also featured a limited edition print version distributed annually.   A business acquisition allowed me to focus on new projects, and a few close business colleagues and I started Rocky Mountain Mr. & Ms. Magazine, a lifestyle publication for men and women in the Magic City.   After a year and a half at the helm of RM3 Magazine, the business was purchased. I now run a web development company SkyPoint Studios.  Recently, SkyPoint Studios has expanded to locations in Havasu, Arizona & Vegas. SkyPoint Studios is a market leader in both Billings & Havasu and I'm working on building that same level of market dominance in Vegas.  Specialties: Extensive experience in online and offline business. Especially savvy at WordPress, and operate several sites

If you check out my portfolio progressive web app below please make sure to clear your cache or view in a private browser, it is updated very often. Also keep an eye out for some well hidden easter eggs. (6 total)  // More info about my Portfolio   My portfolio is built from the ground up using JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5. I decided to develop without the use of frameworks or a CMS like WordPress to show that I can create a fully responsive website without having a CMS do all of the heavy lifting for me. A solid understanding of how things work is a must for a developer.   My portfolio is a progressive web app (PWA) This means that you can download it onto your device, and it will work when there is no internet available as well as some other cool stuff under the hood. This site is hosted on github pages, meaning I have no access to the .htaccess file. This limitation made optimizing my site a creative task. I was still able to achieve straight 100’s on my lighthouse audit. I treat my portfolio like a playground, if I have a ridiculous idea in the middle of the night I’ll pop out of bed and code it into my site.

I realized my passion for coding when I was 15 years old, tinkering with and trying to make my own Pokémon custom ROMs. Since then, my passion for coding has not stopped growing. My coding education began independently, teaching myself popular coding languages starting from Java to C#. In 2018, I found Lambda School and fell in love with the fresh ideas the school represented. I applied, got in and haven't look back. During Lambda, I was exposed to the most popular full-stack web technologies, such as Javascript, React, Redux and more. Lambda School expanded my coding horizons to other Computer Science curriculums such as Python, Data Structure, C, and Computer Processes. Not stopping there, I have continued to improve myself by enrolling at Western Governor University in Computer Science. I worked hard and complete over half of the required credits in just a 6 months term. The competency model that WGU offers really fits my style of studying. I love to tinker and explore for myself. Im great at learning through doing and appreciate any opportunity to learn. 
I have a Master’s degree in Library and Information Science, in which I concentrated on digital curation, preservation and databases.

I loved it, so I decided to apply to the Grace Hopper Program to sharpen my skills.

Software developer, problem solver, technology enthusiast  ,I've always had a love for all things analytical and logic-oriented. Ever since the grade school logical problems of  grass is to green as sky is to ________ , I was hooked on solving puzzles of all forms. Whether it be a crossword puzzle or a math homework problem, I couldn't get enough of having a problem and working my way towards the answer. After all, math problems are just puzzles with numbers and variables. This is what eventually lead me to pursuing a degree in mathematics.  In addition to math, I have found a love for programming, which I experienced for the first time while at university. Despite the brutal introduction that so many people face when learning programming, I learned to absolutely love the process of banging my head against the keyboard and screen until I hit that magical moment when I run my code and it finally works the way I intended. Because of this immense satisfaction that programming gives me, in addition to the opportunity to create, I enrolled at a full-time, full-stack web development bootcamp hosted by The University of Denver. It has been the best decision of my life and every week I crave the knowledge that allows me to create powerful and beautiful web applications.  I hope to someday use my analytical, logical, programming, and interpersonal skills to be successful enough that I can make a significant difference in the world. Whether I am building web applications that improve people's lives or supporting/volunteering with charities, my life mission is to use the gifts  I've been given to improve other's lives and I can die happy if I am able to create a brighter future for even a single person (but it will, of course, be millions by the time I'm done here).  Thank you for taking the time to read this and have a great rest of your day! ,

Born and raised in Los Angeles while having spent a year in Texas. Although my time in Texas was short, I can proudly say I have adopted the southern hospitality which is something I carry with myself everywhere I go. In my spare time I love to solo travel, attend seminars and listen to podcasts about investment, leadership development and building the right mindset. I enjoy the challenge of jumping outside of my comfort-zone in order to develop mentally and physically and am a huge believer that the day you stop learning is the day you stop living. On the side, I have my own clothing brand known as Stay Ambitious; the message behind my brand is to promote wellness and inspire oneself to reach their full potential. I live and breathe what I stand for and love seeing and helping others develop.  Throughout the last five years, I have dedicated my time working in the logistics/supply chain field. While I have gained a lot of expertise in my field, I found myself wanting more of a challenge. I decided to experiment on the side and came across coding. I was inspired by how much there was to learn and how anyone can create their own world. Just like creating my own clothing brand, I love seeing my creations genuinely connect with others. That was when I became passionate about coding and decided to change careers.  Overall, not only will I bring new ideas, a team player attitude, and a growth-driven mindset into my role but I will pour my heart into any work environment to ensure my work will always exceed expectations. Brief descriptions of my applications can be found on my resume. ,

Before I joined Codeflies last year, I didn’t know much about web development. So I took this as an opportunity to learn something new that I hadn’t learned in my college. After a little bit of research, I came to know about things like HTML, CSS and Javascript. Little did I know that this was bare minimum needed for web development, and the actual process went much deeper than that. So here I would like to write about my training experience and the things. I have learnt in this past 6 months.  The Javascript training began after the basics, and it was after this that I knew that web development was not as easy as I had thought. This was different than any other programming language I had learnt, having things like objects and closures. After working on JS for almost over a month, I had Backbone.js training, where I learnt about the MVC architecture.   As I learned all these things, I faced a lot of challenges. One of the mistakes I made was not going through the basics before jumping into the frameworks, because of which I had to go back and review my JS training. Another mistake I made was not taking styling elements seriously, which has given me some issues occasionally.  In conclusion, my first year as a web developer has been full of training and learning new things, and I’m loving every part of it. One of the best moments for me is the ‘aha’ moment, that brief instance, when, suddenly

First and foremost, I am a very passionate programmer. Ever since my very first code in C++ and python to manipulate the desired output, it has kept me motivated to find solutions to real-world problems using various softwares. It is a never-ending puzzle that constantly drives me to test and ignite my passion for problem-solving.  I truly believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.   From my startup at Vessel to my internship at Apple, Veolia, and TEAMology, I have always been fascinated with the concept of solving problems through code and reaching solutions that impact the world.   At Vessel, I have been working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a web application for my startup that would build an interactive environment for radiologists to use our software to detect tumors using Machine Learning. In addition to this, I create reports that describe our idea in detail along with hunting professionals like Radiologists and Data Scientists to help enhance our idea.   I have been working on my backend servers using PHP, AJAX in my current internship at TEAMology. Along with the backend, I have been working on training machine learning algorithms that allow us to understand the human sentiment of elementary and middle school students. I have been proactively been working designing a chatbot using Google Dialogflow where the interactions between the children and the software would take place.  Even when I am not working, I have  brainstorm on ideas that would allow me to enhance my programming skills. Currently, I have been working on building a personal website that depicts me. I am a very passionate basketball player where that keeps me fit and busy apart from programming. Both pursuits challenge so many aspects of my intellect: creativity, organization, leadership, team building, sequential processing. This keeps me entangled and contained with the never-ending thirst to create powerful things and share them with the community and world.  Technical Skills: Programming Languages: Swift

Started programming for the web in 2008. In the beginning I did much work with XHTML and started designing UIs in Photoshop. Those designs looked terrible, but over the time I've gotten far better at designing and developing for the web.  At the same time I started programming I also started to learn how to play the piano. These skills thus developed simultaneously which I think has been very helpful, for both skills.  In 2010 I got into playing Minecraft, which led me to even more programming in form of making plugins -  written in Java - for the game. Some of these I still maintain, since they have quite a lot of users. This game modification helped me grow my programming skills and interests even further. My strongest programming interests were at the time, and also remained to be, web programming though.  Nowadays I'm fluent in HTML(5), CSS(3) and JavaScript (ES6+) and strive to stay up to date with my coding skills to able to create the best products I can.

After editing a friend´s website I accidentally discovered my passion for web development and I just couldn´t get enough:  •	I went to every meetup, workshop and event connected to the IT technologies.   •	I Got myself into a Full stack (Java) full-time Bootcamp (4.5 months). Out of 160 people that applied they choose only 20, and I was one of the lucky ones.   •	Enrolled Front End course together with 13 girls from Code Excursion community (again 13 out of a 100, and I got in).  The only inconvenience was that they were both at the same time. Made it tricky to coordinate extra workshops with 8-9 hours of coding (studying) every day.   It took months for me to realize WHY I like it so much, and then it hit me: I LOVE LEARNING NÉW THINGS, SEEING NEW PERSPECTIVES, APPLYING NEW WAYS OF SOLVING STUFF (“Great minds do not think alike ! ”).   I love building new things: starting from an empty screen and transforming it into the fully functional website.   •	How do I compare to competition?  I have no idea. I am not competing with everybody. Only with myself.

I am a full stack developer here. I work on high level languages i.e. Java (FX, AWT, Swing), C, C++, Python, C#, Swift & others.  I choose to Program. At the age of 21, had no idea where to start my professional career. Questioned myself, about my interests but got no answer. Back in my teenage, trivial interest of playing games on computer help me taking the decision. After consulting one of my software engineer cousin eventually, I transferred my majors to BS Computer Science.  While studying the fundamentals of programming, I realised this is what I wanted to do with my life! I really like the way of  Ordering & Dictating  a program to do, whatever I’ve told it to do (PS: Don't worry, I'm not that Submissive). And the program has to respond back with some results either positive or negative, Doesn't matter!  Programming & development has become so fun for me. Because I do what I have to and I know how to turn the code into my favour. I strongly believe where there is a bug, there's always a way to deal with it. And with time & experience, I am becoming a Picasso of it.  At present, I'm working as WordPress Developer at Programmers Force, I find happiness in doing my responsibilities which includes core command on PSD to HTML, PSD to WordPress, customizing theme, Plugin development, CSS, JS

My passion lies at the intersection of Product and Engineering. I love building. 🛠🚀😎  My career so far can by divided into 3 Acts :  Act I : Computer Graphics  While at Michigan, I was drawn into the world of Computer Graphics Programming due to the pure stimulation of turning written code into a visual image. I spent 11 years in the Visual Effects / Animation Industry as a generalist, with a focus on all things rendering and shading. I loved that there was always something new to learn and several layers of depth to explore in any given topic.  Act II : iOS  Living in Santa Monica, I saw first-hand the innovation happening in Web & Mobile and wanted to be a part of it. I was lucky enough to learn iOS Development from zero while at Originate. This led to working with various early stage startups and building MVPs for clients. I was fortunate enough to be Lead iOS for Studio TIU, which was featured a few times by Apple under 'New Apps We Love' and 'App of the Day'.  Act III : Mobile + Augmented Reality  Pivoting into iOS, I knew that it was inevitable that my worlds would collide. With Augmented Reality on the brink of being a major platform shift, I have been very involved in the community and have co-founded a location-based AR startup Neon. I now see product and technology through this lens and am very excited for what the future will bring! ,

Please feel free to contact me for anything from asking a simple question, reviewing work, making a personal connection with someone I know, to even grabbing coffee and mentoring. I look forward to helping in any way that I can.  Five things that make me good at what I do :  1. No Fear to Fail - Allows me to push boundaries without worrying about the risk. I build faster knowing that I can get to my failures faster and overcome / fix them quicker.  2. Desire to Change - Most people love their comfort zone and hate to change. I desire things to constantly be evolving. Granted this puts way more work on my plate, but it also pushes me to better myself everyday.  3. Imagination - I embrace my childlike way of life. I love to have fun, whether it is playing video games, watching animated movies, or even day dreaming of other worlds. To push past what we know, we need to imagine things outside of the known. Mixing things together that don't make sense is done by using your imagination. I tend to come up with my best ideas after I have been acting like a kid for a couple hours.  4. Devil's Advocate - Most people love and hate me for this reason at the same time. I will practice this characteristic when I believe others are settling for something that can be better. I love asking questions to stir up answers that might not have come out if everyone agreed. I enjoy ripping ideas apart, to find why the person really is pursuing the idea. Sometimes I find out that they just are in it for the money and they didn't actually think about solving a problem.  5. Passionate - Giving up is for those who don't have a reason to keep going. Many people have succeeded against all odds, because of their passionate drive. I only work on what I am passionate about. Lastly, I am very passionate about creation and new ideas. I love helping other brainstorm and strategize how to make their idea come to life and be successful. , Joalbright ,

Passionate about mobile applications and their integration with embedded systems. Interested in an internship or full-time job at a well renowned, fast paced, and innovative company. ,
For over 20 years, I've built business solutions around technology. Since 2000, I've watched the rate at which businesses adopt emerging technologies rise, which requires us as technology leaders to keep entire workforces connected. Increased connectivity with customers and vendors must be supported by enhanced infrastructure including computers, mobile devices, cloud solutions, and media creation software.  Over the years, I've learned and practiced the critical art of building bridges between technology and people. Without people who are engaged with their hearts and minds in technology solutions, business sees little improvement. Successful implementation of technology solutions requires deep collaboration and empathy. Great business leaders listen to their people, understand their challenges, and find ways to improve technology. Successful execution also requires communication and training, which requires an understanding of how the workforce thinks and learns, reasons for why the new solution exists, and a level of teaching mastery to effectively educate workers in the use of new technology.  These are the principles and philosophies I promote as a leader in technology-driven organizations. I have a strong reputation as a technical expert, but even more so as a leader of teams. I enjoy coaching and mentoring team members as much as I enjoy managing projects.   Most recently, I was involved with a renewable energy startup. Through this experience, I migrated a few degrees away from hands-on technical work and led the organization as a senior executive. The company recently ceased operations
Just your average developer who spends way to much time finding the most ridiculous way to solve a simple problem  ,Experienced iOS Developer with five years of mobile experience.   I started my career in the IT industry almost immediately out of high school in 2006, I began by working for friends and family building PCs and setting up simple home networks. By taking on small tasks and gradually leading up to bigger prospects and eventually working full time in the field, I was able to broaden my understanding of technology which eventually led me to working on development.  Since 2013, I have been working with iOS Development. It began as a hobby but quickly developed into a beloved passion of mine. Once Apple released its first Beta of Swift back in late 2014, I was instantly hooked on it. Since then, I have been working very closely with the Swift language and its development over the years into what it is today. I have learned much about iOS and its respective SDK/frameworks and to this day, I still am extremely passionate about it and don't see that changing anytime soon.  Over the years I've been working on expanding my development knowledge, understanding other tools and stacks better.  I am currently working on Game Development using Unreal Engine 4 as my hobby and iOS development as my career. ,

Sexagenarian engineer with deep experience in iOS, Swift, and ObjectiveC/C++. Actively looking for a  mostly  remote role (I'm 2.5 hours commute to NYC, but can come in from time to time on short notice).  Passionate about iOS development - I immediately embraced Swift and switched over to it for all new development, and am loving it!  After five years of OS X development, I crossed over to iOS where I've been ever since. Thus, not only do I have a strong background on all the legacy Foundation frameworks used in both platforms, but have prior UNIX experience with the core OS underpinnings. In addition, as a MSEE I'm quite comfortable around hardware, and built and coded a wind turbine controller a few years ago.  I also give back - see the over 1000 answers I've given on StackOverflow where I'm rated in the top 1%. Look at the open source software that is not only offered, but supported, on both github and SourceForge.  I get the job done, on schedule, with the desired quality—meaning I can spin a quick release with reasonable quality if needed, or craft a much more robust one with more time. I work well with people much younger than me and constantly strive for self improvement ,

When I grew up as a kid, I knew I would be a creator of some sort with the amount of tinkering I did: opening radios, fixing bikes, learning wood working, etc. That idea from when I was a kid became a reality when I first started programming later on in my life. I started my Computer Science degree not knowing what specific area I wanted to focus in, but that I knew this was my calling. That confusion changed when I took an iOS Development course in my university. I knew exactly what I wanted to do.   After discovering my passion for iOS Development, I just couldn't get enough. I now know that my passion is creating products of my own, but also working with product owners/designers to turn ideas into reality bringing quality products to consumers/users. I have had the opportunity to create an app for PIECED, complete an iOS Development Internship with Glassdoor, released an app onto the App Store, mentored multiple students in iOS development, and there's no stopping now.

I try to live what I love, do what I love.  I've been doing iPhone development since 2007 and I can proudly tell that I'm pretty good at Objective-C and Swift. Fully using (POP) Protocol Oriented Programming Patterns as well as OOP, I try to create applications only that I will also use through my daily life.   Nowadays UI/UX means more in Mobile App Development than coding itself. Everyone can code these days but one has to have great taste in design to make an App perfect. I'm not a professional designer but I do know which design is good and which is bad. I can fetch that one little-tiny-small bit of thing that makes an app successful.  I also have experience in mobile marketing, which means I know how to make and sell great apps.  Other than geeking around I love to Sing, I love to take Photographs, I love to lie down and do nothing. I've been in a choir for 5 years and conducted for a year.

I am a senior iOS Developer with over 4 years experience developing commercial iPhone/iPad applications and over 20 years commercial programming experience.  Although I am very focused on iOS development, I do have significant senior management experience which is often useful in project planning, execution, team mentoring and in client-facing situations.  I care passionately about usability and maintainability of the software I create. I find maintainability brings a focus on testability, automation, separation of concerns, evolving systems sympathetically with their original intent, using appropriate technologies, making illegal states unrepresentable and removing barriers to iteration speed. My interest in maintainability is leading me to be increasingly interested in strongly-typed functional languages; such as Haskell and Swift.  For additional information about products, 
An enthusiastic mobile developer with a passion for iOS development and all things Apple.  My favourite thing about software development is the challenge, the puzzle.

I like keeping up to date with the newest technologies and trends. I’m an iPhone fan (that’s why I prefer writing native iOS over other software). I have made a single Android app so far and most days after work I’d go home and work some on personal iOS projects to unwind!

I work as iOS Software Engineer at Sky Betting & Gaming in Leeds - the game changing betting company born out of Sky. We’re aiming to be the UK’s best digital business, constantly innovating and with the mission to ensure players understand the potential risks associated with gambling, the rules around betting integrity, and know how to look out for signs of potential harm in their gaming.  My career in the mobile development industry started late; during my studies I worked a lot as systems integrator for small businesses and as C/C++ developer in many minor projects, which introduced me to the world of software development. I wasn't new to embedded platforms at the time but smartphones never got me as much as Robotics or GPU development, until I did my internship with the S.I.A. in Palermo. During my period as an intern, I developed a prototype for a modular and responsive native Android app which laid the foundation of the official UniPa app.  After almost a year as a freelance Android Developer, I was hired by MangoADV, which was in search of an iOS Developer. I didn't found any major issue in switching my main working platform and environment, I thought it was instead a stimulant opportunity to push further my career. I learned Objective-C, Swift, Protocol Oriented Programming and I also developed many apps plus a SDK for mobile in-app advertising. That year as an iOS Developer engaged me so much that I put myself in play again, so I joined the first ever European Developer Academy founded and run by Apple Inc. in Naples, where I learned how to embrace an Agile environment and how modern companies work on ideas while bringing them to life.   My aim is now to become a wiser and better developer: project after project, solution after solution. I still work on what made me love the world of computers since I was a child (computer graphics and game development), but for the time being I am having a great time with mobile platforms so I think I'll save those skills for the next big shift in my career! , AndrosTMM

BREXITING (verb) /brekziting/ 1. Telling everyone at the party that you are leaving, but actually staying.   “I didn’t have enough time to write short code, so I wrote a long one instead.”   There is a fundamental irony in a VR  company not allowing remote work.               Running out of breath between the 'last gleaming' and 'whose broad stripes' in 'The Star-Spangled Banner'. Is it just me?    Last time I drove in Germany I forgot we were supposed to drive on the wrong side of the road, thing is it didn't matter too much as I was driving a Cheiftain Mk10 MBT.....not sure if I had a Green Card.    Waterfall vs. Agile is a false dichotomy. They're both subtypes of business-driven engineering. It's like arguing for gonorrhea because  at least it's not syphilis .

I am a self-taught iOS developer currently working at Redbox Mobile and as an independent developer. I primarily develop for iOS and other Apple platforms using Swift but have some experience with other programming languages too.  At Redbox Mobile, I am the sole developer of the Redbox Toolbox iOS and macOS app but feed into a wider development team alongside the company’s other product - the Blackbox Platform.  The Redbox Toolbox is primarily aimed at other small iOS developers who can’t necessarily afford to pay ASO agencies to write their app’s metadata for them. Initially created to help account managers at Redbox Mobile speed up metadata creation time, it was officially launched on the App Store in 2019 to a wider audience after going through a number of iterations that have expanded the feature set. It now contains multiple tools that enable an app owner to gain a deeper insight into their apps.  Alongside working at here, I have been independently developing my own applications for iOS, watchOS, macOS and tvOS since 2016. This initially started as a hobby, but I have since gone on to develop a number of successful applications worthy of a sustainable business; my most well-known app being Shift Keyboard which was featured on a number of high-profile Apple specific news sites such as 9to5Mac and Cult of Mac.The app itself has even ranked in the Top 10 Overall Paid Apps in the US and many other countries worldwide. ,
