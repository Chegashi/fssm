I am privileged to have lived the American Dream. I first entered the world of fashion in 1970 when I moved to New York City with a few jersey dresses I had made in Italy. Just two years later, I founded the company that bears my name. In 1974, I introduced the wrap dress, which came to symbolize independence and power for generations of women. DVF is now a global luxury lifestyle brand.   As I have become empowered myself, I have dedicated my life to empowering other women through fashion, philanthropy and mentorship. As Chairwoman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), I help to foster emerging talent in design. For more than a decade, I have served on the board of Vital Voices, an organization that supports female leaders and entrepreneurs around the world.

With my corporate headquarters in New York’s Meatpacking District, I was proud to be involved in the campaign to save the historic High Line railway and to develop The High Line into what it is today.

I teach my public seminar for data leaders seeking to learn how to create useful, usable, and simple data products that actually get used and produce value. We begin 7/13/20;   I help data product leaders turn machine learning and analytics into simple, innovative decision support software—because customers don't use or value technically right, effectively wrong solutions.   If your customers and stakeholders can't or won't use your data-driven software to make decisions, then the technology was just a costly exercise, not an innovation. It doesn't matter whether it's traditional analytics, ML, AI or BI.

Hello! Originally from Toronto, I graduated from OCAD University in Graphic Design. I moved to San Francisco to join LinkedIn's design team. I love working with people and my skills range from visual to user experience design. Also a painter on the side!  
I’m a passionate, empathetic UX Designer driven to make a positive impact by applying human-centered design to real world problems. I love to create responsive digital products for all screen types that are easy to use and fun for the user. I believe great UX is learning, observing, ideating, iterating and testing.  As an UI/UX designer I have a strong portfolio of web application design that shows a fluency in Adobe Creative Cloud, Balsamiq, Adobe XD, Invision, Framer, Figma, Camtasia, HTML3, CSS and unique ways to create wire-frames and cutting comps. While maintaining focus on business goals I never lose sight of developing a maximized user-centered experience. That means meshing your client’s intent and the target audience.
With over 20 years of experience, I have worked in companies small to large, start-up to established, and retail to services. Starting in graphic design, bringing a user-design-thinking approach to brand strategy, creative, marketing, operations, and customer experience for enhanced interaction user experience design.

Creative Director with over 10 years of experience working for Fortune 500 clients, as well as agencies of all sizes. ★ Start-up mentality with experience managing teams in large organizations. ★ Passionate about visual design as a way to communicate with customers.  I've been blessed with the opportunity to work for a number of amazing agencies that have given me the opportunity to work with clients like ✔ Walmart ✔ Harley-Davidson ✔ Hilton ✔ Honda ✔ Salvation Army ✔ Honey Baked Ham ✔ Many others  I thrive in cultures where leaders and managers lead by example, roll up their sleeves, and support the teams that deliver a finished product that provides maximum benefit to the client.

I want to be a lighthouse for people who are truly passionate about the impact of the work they do  With my team at The Ronin, I’m closing the generational comprehension gap.   Young people with their cancel culture, twitter fingers, and severe mental health problems, have the exact same problem as the brands trying to reach them. There’s an indisputable lack of empathy between young people and the rest of the world.   The gap is two sided… there’s a difference between having the emotional intelligence to understand a problem, and having the empathy to solve it.   We built The Ronin to enable brands, creators and people to be empathetic to their community or audience.   We built The Kinyu to enable us to be empathetic to our own.   In order to build win:win solutions between your brand and the community you’ve built around it, people have to empathize with others.   That’s where our emphasis on design comes from ( not simply graphic design, but design in a holistic sense). Design + Empathy, that’s the key.   If I message you, It’s because as cliche, annoying, and oversaid as this is... nothing makes me happier than being able to help people help others. So let's chat! I have cliches for days.

A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. I'm a perfectionist by nature and that one quality ensures persistence and obsession in my work. I tend to keep working till i attain a level of satisfaction in my work, Professionally, it must be combined with smart work as well as time management to always adhere to dead lines. Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living, It's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope. We have to continually be jumping off cliffs and developing our wings on the way down. Creativity cannot be achieved by monotony or by impeding ideas. The brain has to constantly be into an over drive. I believe in taking inspiration from all the amazing works of all designers alike, but never in replicating them because I prefer to leave my personal signature on every piece of my own work.,

Failure will never overtake me if my determination to succeed is strong enough. ... My passion in life has always been in high technology and pushing the boundary of technical progress. Growing up in a country where life was constantly challenging and not always fair to people of lower economic status. To give back all the opportunity that was given to me after I moved to the US, I have made a mission in life to be highly successful in everything that I do. Therefore it always excites me to learn more and come up with new ideas to solve the challenges that we all share. My fervent desire to add values to the world has always been my core principle.  In my quest for success, I have jotted down ideas and laid down plans to meet my objectives. This planning has placed me on an exciting journey that constantly puts me outside of my comfort zone. Although I have ultimate belief in my visions, I know from several selected advisors that I can’t do it alone, it will take a team of high performing individuals to make an idea come to life. In this pursuit, I’m always building new connections and continuously searching for high performing individuals to make it all a reality.

I believe that the tech industry's ability to engage with the implications of what it produces grows slower than our ability to build new things. Hence I take a historical, social approach to the construction of technical artifact – through thoughtful analysis of software, the conceptualization of society it encodes within, and of societies it overlooks. I hope to build knowledge and human infrastructure, through the development of technological infrastructure, that sustains through the aging of our industry.,zeerakahmed,

has an inclination toward fantasy art. Her dynamic style and focus on the new age makes her an architect who likes to experiment with novel ideas with particular focus on the renewed relevance of topological reasoning and experimentation. Inspired by her LATE grand mother who was great interior decorator, growing up seeing her creativity, Maham takes her mentor's creative mind to untapped levels. Her BA Architecture from Punjab University enables her to exploit her talents beyond the mundane by working productively in series – to describe, conceptualise, theorise and ultimately project new topological ideas.” I believe every art form is interrelated because with everything we first have to visualise and ultimately create.

a digital creative director and senior user experience designer based in London, with over a decade of experience in multimedia design. During my career, I've worked with companies ranging from some of the most innovative startups to Global 500 companies on projects that reach millions of people every day. Bellow, you can find a summary of what I do and some of the things I stand for. You can check out some of my work on my website: portfolio/  With a background in computer engineering and architecture, I can say I have a unique perspective and skill set for a creative director/designer that has always allowed me to see further and deeper than others in my field. I think these domains are all interconnected and my ability is to combine the rational aspect of engineering with the innovative touch of architecture and the free spirit of graphic design. I stand somewhere in the middle of these three main lines, so my design style is: rational, innovative and nonconformist.  Ever since childhood, I had a special connection with paper and pencils. Actually, every project of mine starts on paper, it doesn’t matter what type of project, it helps me focus and it inspires all of my creations. I believe the secret to doing great work is having fun. For me, design is never work, it’s my passion, and when you love what you do, you can achieve anything.  I’m a strong believer that going outside our comfort zone sparks true innovation and takes us where we wouldn’t usually dare to go. Neale Donald Walsch has a quote about this, and it goes like this: “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” I like to encourage the people I care about and also my clients to do the same thing. We may fail now and then when outside our comfort zone

I design critically important pixie dust to make an organization hum! What does it mean? I work on the culture and people because thats important for the success of any organization.  I believe in ABC (Always Be Cultivating) philosophy by thinking of recruitment as a sales process. If you want A-players on your team, your company must spend as much time and effort attracting and retaining employees as it does on finding and keeping customers.  Talent Acquisition should be run like a marketing campaign for a product. A candidate's entire journey from the time they see your ad, until they join your company says a lot about the brand.Their exit also matters so that they can keep continuing employer branding of you.  I do not believe in yearly performance appraisal. It doesn't work! What works is constant feedback, team building and focusing on leadership skills. You see a problem and you work on it. Do not wait for a year to appraise. I help build teams, strengthen coordination, team work, cross functionality, process mapping. Everything got to be practical and effective otherwise its of no use.  Am a technology geek. Always curious to learn what's new! I believe technology helps optimize processes and business growth. I have worked on various HRMS softwares implementation like MiHCM Oracle and other interesting cloud based platforms. Customized modules, heavily work on the data, designed reports to find interesting information to further build an action plan. ROI matters.   So if this makes sense and you think we are on the same page, then why wait ? Let's talk!

I completed my Masters of Design in Information and Interface Design at the National Institute of Design, Bangalore, India in 2016. I am also a graduate of National Institute of Fashion Technology in Fashion Communication, Bangalore, 2012.  I am by heart a problem finder and solver. I believe design is a process of not only finding the right solution but also looking for the right problem and it is as important. Right problem gives meaning and value to a solution and our journey of thinking. The simplest way that I practice this is by observing things, people and physical interfaces around me in my daily day to day life, questioning, what, how and why a thing or a person behaves a certain way. I love to explore new challenges, design problems that might not even have a solution yet or have not been seen as a design problem yet. My daily inspiration comes from reading blogs, looking at other great designer's work and keeping an eye on the industry. I proudly take ownership of my work but also know it deep down that good work cannot be done alone, it thrives on collaboration and feedback.,Shatabdii,

Design generalist, mentor, & indie maker. Serially featured on Google Play and iOS App Store, including repeated App of the Day features. Conversion rate booster. Design system fanatic. Usability devotee.  𝗙𝗨𝗟𝗟 • My journey isn't one dating back to some early point in childhood. If only I knew at that age that felt tips, sticky notes, and whiteboards could form the basis of a job — let alone one so fulfilling and meaningful. Instead, it hinges on a few moments of revelation at the meeting of two unusual bedfellows: geography and design.  As my fellow geographers will know, geography closes no doors. It is open, expansive, and accommodating. It morphs to you, not you to it. Through its spatial lens, I observed design in action — its power, its consequences, its good, its bad. To give but one example, my thesis set in areas as culturally diverse as they were financially deprived gave a first-hand account of how individuals often remained adrift of community life not as a result of self-imposition, but sub-optimal design. A troubling yet deeply motivating conclusion.  By graduation, my path had been mapped. It was to deviate from observing design to enacting it. That began with talented developer friends generously partnering with me on a series of indie apps. An immense learning curve ensued

I'm a Product Designer who's been building web and mobile products since 2012.  I believe that while technology has changed a lot, people haven’t. We — the people — remain curious, hungry for knowledge and, well, unpredictable. Put together, curiosity, hunger and unpredictability make the perfect storm for innovation.  In a world where technology is there to serve people, and not the other way around, I’m one of those optimists who think there’s no better time to be alive. Every day, new tech is created. Every day, a designer is tasked with taking such tech and making it usable by and understandable for humans.  Furthermore, I consider designers to have an increasingly important role in shaping the future not only by making complex technologies simple, but also by holding one another accountable for our design decisions both from a moral and human perspective.  Good design, therefore, can't be only about beautiful pixels and smooth interactions. It’s about connecting with people and serving them with purposeful experiences. It’s about helping people do more with less. It’s about problem-solving. It’s about empathy, about understanding the people you’re designing for and going as far as feeling their pains, fears and frustrations as if they were your own.  And, yeah

My passion to architecture started once I decided to study in this field. But after the five years passed I became more passionate about architecture and how to built  an environment that can affect its occupants at a human scale. From here I started my journey in practicing my architectural passion in real projects and in visiting construction sites to see how the detailed drawings  are applied in real construction. Then my interests in architectural design reside in interior architecture and how the built environment can affect the person at a psychological and emotional level, and I think this is essential to successful architectural design. Since in my opinion, design in interior spaces is an intimate creative process that requires an attention to detail and artistic ability. Then I started to work in a firm that focuses on interiors and my passion grows more and more when I started to interact with people. learned how to work with a variety of people with different types of expertise and gained knowledge in applying the creative design process to a variety of scales and applications. I learned how to manipulate architectural spaces in a variety of environments, even those that were originally unfamiliar to me, and how to adjust to environments that were not my own. At the end all of this makes me an excellent communicator and a strong team leader where I have developed robust knowledge in hospitality interiors and architectural designs, providing excellent solutions with passion to space planning and a wide knowledge of materials and production of construction documents.  Demonstrated ability to carry out project tasks in linear fashion and demonstrate successful completion of tasks within established budget parameters and meeting deadlines within those same parameters.,

I am an interior designer with 10 years’ experience plus valuable sales background. I believe that my sales background is a strong point in what I do as I had the chance to directly interact with customers and I learned a lot on how to listen, discover, observe, communicate and respond with best possible solutions for clients.   Choosing to practice design as my profession was an easy decision, as my first exposures to construction environment started early in my life, waking up the passion for design- with my father being in the field for over twenty-five years…    My design career path is strongly related to interior design products and it is a privilege to work with best known design furniture manufacturers. It is a privilege to be involved in looking after showroom set ups, always keeping client’s interest in mind, as I believe that it is important to make them feel at home and to say “I want my home designed here…”     I know, designing spaces is not an easy task, but a very challenging one…and sometimes even confusing, considering the abundance of styles and products, issues to address…   I do my best to deeply engage with my clients in their design journeys, looking to take them somewhere new, looking to create their own design stories and as a result, each project is different, reflecting their own visions. Each project is about my clients.    Nothing brings more pleasure then knowing that my clients’ emotional relationship with their homes grows and becomes more satisfying with time, living & enjoying the life style that we created together through good design. My number one intension is elevated clients’ experience and I love every minute of the whole process! And so, I find my job meaningful every day, realizing I could help others.    I believe in designing with love and that good design should feel un-designed.
