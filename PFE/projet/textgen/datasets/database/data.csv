"ch2104","i work as ios software engineer at sky betting & gaming in leeds - the game changing betting company born out of sky. we   re aiming to be the uk   s best digital business, constantly innovating and with the mission to ensure players understand the potential risks associated with gambling, the rules around betting integrity, and know how to look out for signs of potential harm in their gaming.  my career in the mobile development industry started late  during my studies i worked a lot as systems integrator for small businesses and as c/c++ developer in many minor projects, which introduced me to the world of software development. i wasn't new to embedded platforms at the time but smartphones never got me as much as robotics or gpu development, until i did my internship with the s.i.a. in palermo. during my period as an intern, i developed a prototype for a modular and responsive native android app which laid the foundation of the official unipa app.  after almost a year as a freelance android developer, i was hired by mangoadv, which was in search of an ios developer. i didn't found any major issue in switching my main working platform and environment, i thought it was instead a stimulant opportunity to push further my career. i learned objective-c, swift, protocol oriented programming and i also developed many apps plus a sdk for mobile in-app advertising. that year as an ios developer engaged me so much that i put myself in play again, so i joined the first ever european developer academy founded and run by apple inc. in naples, where i learned how to embrace an agile environment and how modern companies work on ideas while bringing them to life.   my aim is now to become a wiser and better developer  project after project, solution after solution. i still work on what made me love the world of computers since i was a child (computer graphics and game development), but for the time being i am having a great time with mobile platforms so i think i'll save those skills for the next big shift in my career! , androstmm "

"dh0473","curiosity is what drives any hacker. hackers take great pride in finding things they are not supposed to find. in my case i have always been curious about how things work in this world. i think its almost an innate ability that hackers carry with them. i believe that one doesn't choose to be a hacker, it just happens when you wake up one day and realize that the entire world tries to control you in some form or the other with or without your consent and you are not ready to accept that. it's only a matter of time before you start asking questions and the answers are really hard to come by. even if they come by from others, you ask yourself how much can you really trust them  just because everyone else believes that something is right doesn't make it right. i live by that motto. i tend to verify things for myself and i think all the hackers out there live by a similar motto. for me, trust is the weakest link that exists in this world. trusting others means you assume that when others are in control they will not betray you and get the better of you. so what do hackers do  they make sure that their trust is not betrayed by keeping an eye on what others are doing.   what you see is what you get  is a phrase that almost everyone is familiar with. but if you ask a hacker, he will tell you that there is very little or no truth to that. it is like a mask that is being presented to the world while all the details are hidden behind it."
"dh0474"," hacking , the first thought that comes to everyone's mind is  it's illegal , isn't it  a passionate mind is suppressed by others not to be a part of it. everyone thinks about the worst side of it but no one cares of patching it. for an ethical hacker the great challenge is not to hack someone but to explain others that the way he took is not illegal. the last thing that i found in this world is that none hacker is inferior not even a newbie, if you are expert in one thing the person sitting infront of you might be expert in other."

(3)  the web developer  me , likes to build full-stack and responsive websites. he's tired of conventional bootstrap & php - and rather prefers rapid prototyping with python frameworks - flask & django. however, even after quite some experience, he can often be found ranting about the ever-increasing number of new javascript frameworks to be learned, when asked to choose from jquery, angularjs, reactjs.  (4) the coffee lover  me , is just a persona that is induced by the above three personas, to keep away from sleep and to battle the rants of the above three personas on a day-to-day basis.
