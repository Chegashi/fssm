The analysis included building fixed- and random-effects multivariate regression models and Levihnson-Petrin/Oley-Pakes production functions with the use of Stata to assess the relationship between labor costs and firm productivity. I presented the paper at a conference organized by the Institute of Labor Economics at the African Development Bank in November 2017. The work has featured in The Economist, Quartz Africa, and several regional/African media outlets.  Founded a data visualization venture, called ""Chart of the week"" series, consisting of a series of blogs, focused on data visualization to present latest development economics research in an effective manner.

Metro Area",,,"Hi, I am Vyjayanthi but I also go by VJ!  Right out of college, with a Bachelor's degree in IT, I knew I wanted to continue working with technology but not in the web tech/software engineering domain. I started with product analytics and management at a software company. One of my key achievements here was using data driven decisions to make business recommendations towards the redesign of my product. These recommendations helped the company in increasing the user base for the product. This solely happened because I am someone who has the skills to deep-dive into the product not only from the corporate business side but also from the customer perspective. I am adept in identifying pain points from a user point of view. This is precisely when I realised I can leverage data, which is present in any and all industries, tap into insights that weren't explored before and benefit not only the company, but the consumer as well. A couple of experiences later, I am now a proud Master's graduate from the University of Maryland - go Terps! - looking to leverage my skills in an industry and company that is not only focused on their corporate standing but also the social good of the community. That is who I want to work for.  I am also dedicated to continued learning/education. With the evolution of technology, it is vital to stay at the forefront of that advancement. As a by-product of this belief, I hold an online nano-degree in Predictive Business Analytics.  Apart from my academics and career, I like to read (crime, mystery - Agatha Christie is my #1) and travel (I'm fortunate enough to have visited over 10 countries).  Tech Capabilities: R, SQL, Python, Tableau, Alteryx, data analytics, data science, business intelligence Other Capabilities: Open communication based leadership, deep diving into data for problem solving, perseverance towards finding a working solution  Please do visit my website! - https://vyjayanthik.wixsite.com/vjkamath",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University System of Maryland","Data Analytics & Visualization Consultant","Feb 2020","May 2020","I worked with the Office of Economic Development over the past few months to redesign their data ingestion platform.

The common theme across my direct work with attorneys, CFO, CRO, CTO and CDO has been deriving highly impactful and results-oriented actionable business insights from data, as a senior data scientist.   For example, I helped numerous lawyers at Ogletree Deakins in estimating total liability exposure for clients associated with several multi-million-dollar, class-action lawsuits. In those 4 years, I also invented proprietary Monte Carlo simulation to predict the settlement value of multi-millions class action lawsuit - a first in the legal profession. The work led to a Data Driven Award in 2018: https://www.law360.com/articles/1105806/data-driven-lawyer-ogletree-s-evan-moses   Recently, I worked alongside LoanHero's Chief Risk Officer, developing credit and risk models that were responsible for LoanHero‚Äôs risk and fraud management, accounting for over $100 million in collective transactions. As a first data scientist on Robo-Advisor team at Credit Sesame working directly with CTO, I spearheaded multiple data science initiatives and built a team there. Additionally, I have co-authored a Whitepaper that investigated the actual cost savings for a client using CLARA Provider‚Äôs outcome-based approach as a provider selection tool for workers compensation claims at CLARA Analytics within the first three months. Finally, I'm currently applying data science to improve various processes in multiple departments in Stanford University.   I hold a B.S. in Mathematics and Accounting from UCLA, and a M.S. in Engineering Management from USC. I continue updating my skills and have also earned several certifications including but not limited to: Project Management Professional (PMP), Six Sigma Green Belt, Data Incubator Data Science Bootcamp, Stanford Machine Learning, and Stanford ICME Fundamentals of Data Science.

Vincent developed and deployed new techniques such as hidden decision trees (for scoring and fraud detection), automated tagging, indexing and clustering of large document repositories, black-box, scalable, simple, noise-resistant regression known as the Jackknife Regression (fit for real-time or automated data processing), model-free confidence intervals, combinatorial feature selection algorithms, detecting causation not correlations, and generally speaking, the invention of a set of consistent robust statistical / machine learning techniques that can be understood, implemented, interpreted, leveraged and fine-tuned by the non-expert. Vincent also invented many synthetic metrics that work better than old-fashioned stats, especially on badly-behaved sparse big data. Some of these techniques have been implemented in a Map-Reduce Hadoop-like environment. Some are concerned with identifying true signal in an ocean of noisy data.  Vincent is a former post-doctorate of Cambridge University and the National Institute of Statistical Sciences.  He created the first IoT platform to automate growth and content generation for digital publishers, using a system of API's for machine-to-machine communications, involving Hootsuite, Twitter, and Google Analytics.  Vincent's profile is accessible at https://dsc.news/2GdAtR1 and includes top publications, presentations, and work experience with Visa, Microsoft, eBay, NBC, Wells Fargo, and other organisations.","analyticbridge                            datashaping",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Data Science Central","Executive Data Scientist, Co-Founder, Managing Partner","May 2012","PRESENT","Author, mathematician, open patent inventor, innovator, and investor.

I help businesses create it and parents train their kids for it. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to build a cooler world. (Probably the byproduct of reading way too many Sci-Fi and Fantasy novels...still haven't gotten my letter...)   I love helping people understand technology and how to use it to their advantage. I've learned that for some people it can be a bit scary, but I want to help alleviate those fears to create something even better.   I love solving problems. With some creative thinking, we might not come up with the perfect solution but we can definitely come up with a better one.   I have a diverse background from Biotechnology to Marketing, and I like learning about new industries and their troubles.    I'm passionate about the future of education. I want to empower parents with more options to choose from. I'll gladly work with homeschool students and nonprofits on niche courses in the STEM fields. I've taught standard Math, Science and Coding(AI and Web Development) courses as well as Bioinformatics and Game Development.

The competitive noise suppression technology has lead the solution to be deployed on major mobile phone devices in world wide including some of Samsung Galaxy S and Note series.  These are the two major areas that I spent most of my time:  1) Machine learning - deep recurrent neural network (and its variants like LSTM or GRU) for non stationary noise suppression (including reverberation). I hosted the company's deep learning group where we studied machine learning techniques in both theoretic and practical especially in voice processing area. I implemented back propagation and all regularization techniques by myself in Matlab or Java, but I also use toolkits like Keras, Tensorflow.  2) Beam forming -- I improved the company's beam forming performance particularly in Bluetooth device (aka small array microphone, but not limited to Bluetooth devices) by developing minimal null steering beam forming assisted with robust post processing scheme especially when interfering noise is present together with target signal. I used Visual Studio for quick verification of the algorithms and Xtensa Xplorer for DSP image generation to Fortemedia's iM501 IC via UIF for real time simulation and performance validation.

I had the opportunity to apply NLP and Deep Learning into practical business fields, such as entities detection and document summarization, which has confirmed my determination to delve into AI field. After graduation, I rejoined TR,  working on an exciting project to build a course recommender system for our online course platform similar to Coursera.

My research lies at the intersection of these areas to create physical and virtual interventions that impact lives on a wider scale.  I have been working in the aforementioned areas (both corporate and academia) for 6 years now and even though I have written them separately, I strongly believe in their entanglement. I see research as a practice to ask the right questions when solving a desired problem. I have done some theoretical works like finding error estimators for iterative algorithms (linear algebra), research on gradient based algorithms (deep learning) and have also built intelligent user interfaces for people who are physically challenged (human-computer interaction), machine learning solutions for manufacturing enterprises for detecting defects and root cause analysis (data science).  My recent work is an adaptive virtual keyboard for people with severe speech and motor impairment that can be used using eyes rather than hand held devices like mouse etc. The keyboard is integrated with a customized machine learning algorithm for dynamic adaptation of dwell time (minimum time to click through gaze) by learning user interaction with the interface.

The major research contributions are summarized as follows:  - ClassiÔ¨Åcation of Urban Areas in Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Images: The objective of this study was to be able to identify urban, non-urban and water land cover classes. A simulated urban target was generated to create synthetic urban scattering data, which was used to augment the training data. This improved the generalization ability of the network, improving performance over contemporary techniques.  -Urban Change Detection Using a Semi-supervised Deep Learning Technique: Often in case of a disaster like Ô¨Çoods, a quick characterization of damage to urban areas is required. However, not much ground truth information is available making it diÔ¨Écult to train machine learning models. In this work, an associative manifold growing technique was used to bolster the training minimal information available, and improve change detection performance.  -Combination of Multi-Frequency Radar Data for Crop ClassiÔ¨Åcation: A novel tensorization approach was used to combine a multi-frequency dataset. Each frequency is sensitive to diÔ¨Äerent biophysical parameters of the agricultural crop.

As a result I have a network of some of the best technical people in New England to draw from whenever I start a new job.  Currently, I have used my network to help start up my own company, called Fast Strike Sports, that makes fantasy sports games for state lotteries.  Previously, I was the VP of Science at matchmine where I helped refine an existing recommendation system to make it flexible enough to meet the needs of a wide range of partners (movies, music, videos, blogs and podcasts). This was not a collaborative filtering approach but one that focused on understanding the content of the items and the interests of the users. It required gathering data from many sources, analyzing it, and understanding user behaviors.  The work at matchmine was similar in many ways to work I did at Predictive Networks/Predictive Media. I was with Predictive from beginning to end and helped design an ad targeting system that had 2 million users at its peak, delivered over a billion ads, and had zero down time and zero complaints and in controlled studies was shown to deliver CTR 4-5 times higher than the industry average. Also at Predictive I helped develop a recommendation system for TV and movie viewing that was used to integrate VOD offerings into a unified experience for users. The IP from that venture is currently owned by a holding company for Comcast.  I am looking forward to my next opportunity to lead a technical team tasked with solving interesting problems.

The CS related jobs have the highest demand, and the best compensations. CS is NOT just about sitting in front of the computer and writing code. 2) Having said that, coding IS FUN! It is not boring, it is not something that awkward people do in their basements, it is creative, it is collaborative and it is fun!

By performing linear stability analyses of the critical points, I can determine their stability. My focus is the coexistence critical point since it involves both predators and prey and complex phenomena of interactions. Based on the analysis of the coexistence point, I can find the stability boundaries which separate regions of stability from regions of instability. I explore how the boundaries change with the increase in nonlocality. For the numerical part, I use spectral methods to implement the simulations over periodic domains in Fortran. The simulations determine patterns near the stability boundaries and also nonlinear patterns far from the stability boundaries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""Matlab : 9, Mathematical Modeling : 5, Mathematical Analysis : 5, Statistics : 2, Numerical Analysis : 1, Simulations : 1, Data Structures : 0, OOD : 0, Machine Learning : 1, Web Development : 0, Data Analysis : 1, Shell Scripting : 0, Fortran : 4, C++ : 4, Microsoft Excel : 5, Mathematica : 4, LaTeX : 4, R : 3, Python : 4, C : 2, Databases : 0, JUnit : 0, git : 1, github : 0, Java : 0, JavaScript : 0, CSS : 0, HTML : 0, AJAX : 0, JSON : 0, SQl : 0, MySQL : 0, Eclipse : 0, Apache tomcat : 0, MongoDB : 0, Applied Mathematics : 5, Mathematical Programming : 3, JMeter : 0, Apache Spark : 0, Amazon EC2 : 0, CUDA : 0, MPI : 0, MAMP : 0, ""","",3,,"Computer Software",,,,,"Lowe's Companies, Inc.; Friends of Mathematical Association of America; Google; Northwestern University Alumni; Simon Sinek Inc.; Jamie Dimon"

This has led me to focus on distributed computing and networking, machine learning, natural language processing, security and more. Though these skills don't necessarily lend themselves to a single domain of effort, it has given me a number of perspectives that inform my designs of complex systems. Largely, I am therefore an architect and programmer whose focus is a balance between human and machine intelligence.   These perspectives are also taken from my career in a variety of startups and academia. I've enjoyed being a part of extremely effective small to medium sized teams building recommender systems, reading level classifiers, smart IoT technologies, and streaming analytics. In academia, I've taught applied data science and machine learning at Georgetown University and completed a PhD at the University of Maryland where I studied planetary-scale data systems.   To build great software, you need a great team and as a result, I think knowledge sharing and openness is another critical pillar of my career. I've contributed to many open source projects and am the maintainer of the Yellowbrick Python package - a visual diagnostics tool for machine learning that is affiliated with NumFOCUS. I've presented work at conferences including PyCon and PyData. And finally, I am also an author of two O'Reilly books: Applied Text Analysis with Python and Data Analytics with Hadoop.","bbengfort",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wright State Research Institute","Research Scientist","Jun 2020","PRESENT","","Washington, District of Columbia, United States","https://www.linkedin.com/company/wright-state-research-institute","wright-state-research-institute",,,"Georgetown University","Faculty Director","Mar 2014","PRESENT","Lecturer for the Data Analytics certificate at the Georgetown Center for Continuing Education and Professional Studies.

With my research, I presented them my idea of a baseline architecture of AIOps, that includes what AIOps would like in comparison to existing ticketing and monitoring service architecture, in three steps. 1. What do the company already have that they can use to start their AIOps journey with; 2. What do they need to do to launch framework -- starting from data wrangling to pattern recognition and auto-resolving context-based-grouped tickets, with data engineering and feature engineering as the next steps in the pipeline of AIOps framework; and 3. How predictive/ preemptive analytics will come into play once the ML models are in place. - Greenhouse teams were using excel to generate certain visualizations to have a quarterly review of the number of technology requests they had received for each lab session. I had used Tableau to generate useful reports for them to be able to analyze which city asked for a technology/ infrastructure during a year, how many requests were seen in a given year, to view trend analysis of the data. - To use Zoomforth content experience application on PRYSM (interactive display technology), created a reusable responsive webpage templates that can be uploaded to various Zoomforth projects. - Provided extended support for UX applications that were developed on Pepper during my summer internship. - Trained in PRYSM and CRESTRON technologies. see less","Westlake, Texas","https://www.linkedin.com/company/deloitte","deloitte",,,"Deloitte","Machine Learning Intern","Jun 2018","Aug 2018","Developed a conversational UX for Pepper - The humanoid created by Softbank Robotics using Dialogflow, a chatbot creation tool which is based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology. ‚Ä¢ The goal was to provide seamless user interaction with Pepper using its tablet, and its Natural Language Processing capabilities.

Data science has given me the framework to pragmatically apply my math and science skills to puzzles in a wide range of fields. Whether it's marketing models or semi-conductor research, there is data and there is the potential to use that data for overcoming obstacles.   It‚Äôs always been about the data. In the past I‚Äôve worked as a scientist and engineer to solve problems mostly at the lab bench, but the experiments and solutions have always been driven by data. I used data to define the problem, form a hypothesis, and design the experiments. Then the data collected from the experiments was used to build a model, make predictions, and inspire future experiments.

Here I was responsible for verifying the performance of Watson's models and API's. To expedite the process, I wrote scripts that would be run automatically and populate a dashboard with the latest model test results and information about the run. I was also responsible for constructing test plans so that manual testers could verify that design specifications and user stories were met by our front end design.   After working with IBM I attended Galvanize's data science bootcamp. I learned how to apply data science algorithms to real world data sets to find fraud in Eventbrite events, to classify news articles with NLP and predict partisan leanings, and to predict heavy equipment market values based on auction data.

Working group: CMS Collaboration, Heavy-Ion group.   More about CERN collisions and my particle of interest: My team and I study proton-proton, proton-lead and lead-lead collisions, all at the same normalized energy. The temperature in these collisions are 5 orders of magnitude hotter than the core of the sun! The colliding particles completely break apart and the large amount of energy gets converted to new particles, including fundamental ones (quarks and gluons) as well as extremely heavy ones that are no longer around today but were produced in the big bang.  We look for the Upsilon (Y) particle. These particles are sensitive to the differences in the three collision types. Lead-lead collisions create the quark-gluon plasma, a new phase of matter. Proton-lead collisions display nuclear effects. Proton-proton collisions provide the baseline for what happens in the absence of nuclear and plasma effects. So by measuring Upsilon particles in all three collisions we can quantify nuclear and plasma effects in nature. see less","Geneva Area, Switzerland","https://www.linkedin.com/company/cern","cern",,,"Secrets of the Universe","Featured Scientist and Comp√®re","Sep 2018","PRESENT","Feature in IMAX movie (2019) on the frontiers of scientific exploration, inspiring curiosity and confidence in audiences by depicting the people, technology and challenges in science accurately.

Binary classification: the target is either 0 or 1. I use the pandas, numpy and scikit-learn libraries from Python to read, clean and encode the dataset. Once the data is prepared, I use the machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn to fit a model to the data. The performance of the trained model gives me clues as to which features are important, whether any new features can be engineered, or whether any algorithm parameters can be changed to improve the performance of the model. With the current project data being imbalanced and the client emphasizing on precision, I focus more on feature engineering and data balancing. I implemented a new method to select lesser number of zeros from the original dataset, and this gave better performance as compared to Undersampling or SMOTE methods. 2. Image Recognition: I have implemented an image recognition program using Python and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in Keras to identify whether a document belongs to any one of five classes. The documents are scanned PDFs and extracting text using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is time consuming. Currently, I am able to achieve a 70% accuracy over the five classes. 3.

I took over a senior role, orienting the newcomers from the aspect of our algorithms and development.

I remained the key algorithmic developer. I enhanced our model validation scheme and developed a novel approach to a tough problem that we were trying to solve and that would be groundbreaking in one of the largest consumer markets.  With time I started also engaging with clients and consulting in meetings of product and business development, advising on solution feasibility, trade-offs, estimated timelines, resources, etc. I later took on my first project, working with the client's R&D team to putting together a solution to their need.  I found the contribution to product development and business development to be very empowering, as it allows people from both sides to put together a collaboration that suits both organizations.

In late 2010 Silentium completed a research collaboration with academia with a purpose of achieving a theoretical proof of concept for advancing its technology. Next move was to start developing the mathematical and computational algorithms to achieve what was proven conceptually feasible. I was the first developer brought on board for that purpose. I was fresh out of school but had a strong toolset, unbiased thinking, with a boost of creativity and motivation to do something new. I was tasked with the first algorithmic milestone and given an unlimited amount of time to solve it. It took me less than a week to develop it, implement in code, and validate. It was and remains one of the sweetest moments of my career.  Next we applied it in a physical setting and found that the calculations and the validation in code were correct. We had created a set of quiet spots around a person's head using multiple speakers (while previous existing algorithms only allowed for a single speaker, thus making the quiet spots not as quiet).  Interest from prospective clients started growing and more business came in.  I continued refining our algorithmic toolbag and in the following year I expended the initial algorithm to take-in data from multiple microphones (previous existing algorithms allowed for only a single microphone, thus not accommodating for various noise scattering). This development became known as the Silentium Quiet-Bubble‚Ñ¢.  Algorithmic aspects: - Language: Matlab - Developing solutions: Bayesian statistics for putting together the equations to be optimized, Spectral analysis for supplying the physical constraints of the hardware (speakers in particular), Convex optimization and parameter estimation for setting up a solution to the equations, - Model validation: Train, validation, and test sets. - Code integrity: Putting together tests that validate the output of the algorithm. see less","","https://www.linkedin.com/company/silentium","silentium",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tel Aviv University","Master of Science (M.Sc.)","Machine Learning & Computer Vision","","2013","2016","Master thesis-dissertation under the supervision of Prof. Hagit Messer-Yaron, see details in the publications section.

Some skills that I believe differentiate me from other candidates are thorough understanding of business processes, result-driven actions, and distilling complex analysis into concise business-focused takeaways.  Over the past 7 years, I have worked with companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers, Aegis Limited and Bosch & Siemens where I have worked on creating strategic business plans, forecasting demand, modeling marketing campaigns and improving operational processes by studying data and using various statistical analysis to uncover patterns and trends. It is my superpower and something that I am really passionate about.  At Purdue, I was among the top 25% of students and was honored to be on the Dean's list.  I have participated in various Machine Learning case competitions and hackathons. I won the Google Applied Machine Learning Hackathon, a competition to solve a business challenge using Machine Learning techniques, as well as the SAS Optimization Challenge, where I developed an optimization model for promotion bundling for a FMCG giant  If you are looking to add Analytics capability to your team, who can help drive the business, bring innovative solutions, and who never accepts defeat, I am your guy.

During my time at Boomtrain, I was primarily responsible for the research, design and implementation of our personalized models. Working at a small-stage startup also gave me opportunities to work in a number of different capacities - most notably, I played a primary role in the vision and architecture behind our real-time scoring engine and the associated training pipeline.  The tools I used at Boomtrain include: . Python, Java, and NodeJS (for our various services - all communicating over Thrift) . Tensorflow (for the implementation our models and scorers) . Luigi (for our data-pipeline dependency management and scheduling) . Kafka and Redshift (for the storage and analysis of behavioral data) .

I also participated in the 2014 Quantathon, where my team won 2nd place for a GPU-based scoring routine (SpMat-SpVec multiplication) written in CUDA. Our prototype was over an order of magnitude faster than the existing process at a similar price-point (we achieved this using a combination of Cuckoo and RobinHood hashing, maximizing the number of independent models we could store in GPU-memory).

I Used CART and ensemble methods, boosting and bagging, to build prediction and description models, with time series event data. I contributed research and prototyping analytic algorithms for Clickfox (CEA) product features. I developed numerous analytic tools in R and python.  The most recent project, for a major US bank, predicted silent attrition and attrition. I was the team lead on the project, and was responsible for data mining, data quality evaluation, data engineering, and building and evaluating mathematical models. For this project, I chose to use a decision tree for numerous reasons, most importantly the data was not fully populated, it contained categorical variables, and varying numeric scales.  My team and I researched text mining methods, most successfully a variation of Term Frequency times Inverse Document Frequency (tf*idf), for anomaly detection on event data sets. The goal was to value to the data by assigning customer experience scores. This was very successful and a lot of fun. We planned to introduce a new measurement, similar to NPS and CSAT, to be able to score the entire customer population! We built this in python, using mercurial for source control.  Another area of research was random forest prediction accuracy vs time, number of trees, and bootstrap sample size. I wrote a function in R to present the data as an updating graph, to show the changes in time and accuracy, as the sample size increased and number of trees increased.

Previous studies suggest that the activity of market speculators has driven up the price of crude oil (Davidson, 2008; Engdahl, 2008; Kaufmann & Ullman, 2009; Smith, 2009).The research design is a multivariate time series that tests hypotheses whether open interest (the quantity of undelivered futures contracts) and price are cointegrated. Once the cointegration (or lack) is established, the research will determine which events precedes the other: change in open interest, or price. If, for example, a rising open interest is occurring slightly before a price run-up, there may be reason to believe that crude oil futures manipulation is occurring.","Roosevelt University","MBA","Finance","","2001","2004","Mentored actuarial students, volunteered on social committees",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"""Quantitative Analytics : 99, Quantitative Finance : 58, Capital Markets : 18, Credit Risk : 13, Derivatives : 49, Risk Management : 35, Options : 25, Commodities : 4, Data Mining : 25, Fixed Income : 20, Business Analysis : 19, Statistics : 21, Analytics : 18, Research : 13, Data Analysis : 14, Econometrics : 12, Financial Markets : 10, Risk Analysis : 10, Big Data : 10, Business Intelligence : 8, Higher Education : 7, Knowledge Management : 5, Quantitative Analysis : 7, Modeling : 5, Numerical Analysis : 5, Data Science : 8, Quantitative Modeling : 4, Python : 10, R : 36, C++ : 7, VBA : 57, SQL : 15, Matlab : 12, Bloomberg : 12, LaTeX : 8, Hadoop : 7, Java : 6, Mathematica : 5, tidyverse : 1, MapReduce : 1, Engaging Public Speaker : 6, Monte Carlo Simulation : 27, Time Series Analysis : 22, Predictive Modeling : 12, Predictive Analytics : 13, Bayesian methods : 4, Regression : 4, Interest Rate Derivatives : 1, Apache Spark : 2, ""","8408",3,,"Information Services",,,,,"Data  Visualization and Decision Science; SAP; Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Machine Learning; Oracle; Flash Statistics; Tata Consultancy Services"
